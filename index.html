        <p> My favorite hobby is coding because coding is fun for me. Coding opened many doors in my life and introduced me to new coding platforms like Visual Studio, Brackets, and Codepen, which is where I made my first personal website. Coding gave me a new life, and learning it still gives me pleasure. Also, I have learned to type very well on the keyboard, so I especially love text coding over block coding. Anyway, I love coding, and I will always remember it as my favorite hobby, and I will never, ever forget what I have learned and what I will learn later on in life. </p>
